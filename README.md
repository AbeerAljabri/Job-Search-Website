# Job Search Website

### About the project
Job Search is an online job search system that improves the way job seekers and employers connect online.
Job seekers can use the platform to discover existing job offers, search for them by category, apply to job offers, and check the status of prior job applications. A job provider can post jobs, modify job details, review job applications, and updateÂ their status.
